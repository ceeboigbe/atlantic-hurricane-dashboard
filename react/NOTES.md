# NOTES

Wikipedia entries on hurricanes appear to be able to looked up via the following notation:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_`<name>`_(`<year>`)

Example: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Igor_(2010)

This could be useful in dynamically calling up relevant articles about a historical hurricane.
